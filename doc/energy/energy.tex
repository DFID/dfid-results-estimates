\section{Results}

From 2015/16 to 2019/20 DFID installed \textbf{
771
} of clean energy capacity (Table \ref{tab:energy}). %

When new information becomes available, historic estimates are updated during each annual results reporting round to reflect the best available information on programme achievements. %
As a result, several corrections to past years' data have been made this year. %
A number of programmes, which DFID has supported for multiple years, have reported results for the first time leading to an increase in historic results. %
Simultaneously, corrections were made to results estimates from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), following a review by government analysts and the Climate Investment Fund's (CIFs) audit unit.  %
Corrections have been made where it was discovered that either results were being taken from the wrong source, data were inputted incorrectly, or inappropriate adjustments for over/under reporting had been made. %
These errors are difficult pick up during the quality assurance process since the CIFs rely on implementing partners to report project data accurately in the first instance. %

\section{Context}

This indicator measures clean energy capacity installed as a result of DFID
programming. %

Access to energy is a constraint to inclusive economic growth and job creation across all of DFID's focus countries. %
Population growth is also pushing up energy demand; investments in electricity generation, transmission and distribution and connections have failed to keep pace. %
In our economic development strategy we made clear we will adopt a `climate smart' approach across our economic development work --- including through sustainable energy. %
We are working to help meet businesses' rising energy needs; to ensure affordable energy access for the poor; and to enhance environmental sustainability in energy use. %
