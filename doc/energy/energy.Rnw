\section{Results}

From 2015/16 to 2019/20 DFID installed \textbf{771 megawatts} of clean energy capacity (Table \ref{tab:energy}). %

Historical annual estimates are updated during each new results reporting round to reflect the best available information on programme achievements. %
As a result, several corrections to past years' data from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), were made following a review of Climate Investment Funds (CIF) results by relevant inputting Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) and the CIFs Audit Unit. %
Corrections have been made where it was discovered that either results were being taken from the wrong source, data were input incorrectly, or inappropriate adjustments for over/under reporting had been made. %
This year, a portion of the private finance leveraged by some projects has been reclassified as coming from public sources, causing a fall in private finance leveraged while also driving an increase in public finance leveraged.  %
These errors are difficult to catch during the quality assurance process as the CIFs rely on the relevant managing MDBs to report project data accurately in the first instance. %

\section{Context}

This indicator measures clean energy capacity installed as a result of DFID
programming. %

Access to energy is the number one constraint to inclusive economic growth and job creation. %
Over one billion people lack access to modern energy, 95\% of whom live in Africa and South Asia. %
Access to energy is a critical constraint to growth across all DFIDâ€™s focus countries, and lack of reliable power reduces African GDP by 2-4\%. %

Population growth is also pushing up energy demand; investments in electricity generation, transmission and distribution and connections have failed to keep pace. %
We are doing more to help meet businesses' rising energy needs; to ensure
affordable energy access for the poor; and to enhance environmental sustainability
in energy use. %
In our economic development strategy we made clear we will adopt a `climate smart' approach across our economic development work - including through sustainable energy. %
