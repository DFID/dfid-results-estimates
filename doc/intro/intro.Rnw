This report presents the latest update to our results estimates, with some background information about how and why we monitor each sector. %
Results estimates cover the period April 2015 to March 2020. %
The accompanying \href{Tables}{\textbf{Tables}} provide the same sectoral data, but without the background provided here. %
To fully understand the data we present in the tables and this report, the \href{Methodology Note}{\textbf{Methodology Note}} for each indicator and the \href{Technical Note}{\textbf{Technical Note}} should be consulted, which contain further definitions, guidance and policies applied to the calculation of results estimates. %

DFID collects data across its programmes to monitor its performance and to ensure that it is having a positive impact for the world's poorest. %
Results estimates are figures which have been aggregated from across our programme results, using data collected from a wide variety of sources. %
In 2015, DFID began using its Single Departmental Plan (SDP) as its main results framework, which consists of indicators covering a number of priority areas. %
The SDP covers a five year period from April 2015 to December 2020.
Results estimates cover the whole of this reporting period, with annual updates published once per year in Summer. %


The global disruption caused by COVID-19, and the reprioritisation of DFID's efforts to help tackle the crisis in developing countries, impacted the capacity of our country offices and central staff to adequately quality assure our latest results data for 2019-20 in time for publication in Spring. %
Therefore, considering the Office for Statistics Regulation's guidance on statistical practice during the coronavirus outbreak, and our voluntary commitment to the Code of Practice for Statistics, the Chief Statistician decided to delay publication of updates for some results estimates until August 2020. %
This publication now comprises results for all of indicators including those which were delayed. %
