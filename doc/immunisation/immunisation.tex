DFID provides funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance with the intent of increasing immunisations. %
Gavi is an international organisation with the goal of increasing access to immunisations for children in low-income countries. %
All of DFID's results for this indicator come from Gavi results that are attributed to DFID based on the share of UK funding to Gavi. %
