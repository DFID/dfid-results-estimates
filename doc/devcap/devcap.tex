\section{Results}
DFID invested £3,039 million in Development Capital (DevCap) to create more and better inclusive jobs that benefit people across society, including women.

\section{Context}

The finance needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals is estimated at approximately \$ 2.5 trillion every year but current investment levels are less than half of that. %
DFID uses a range of instruments to finance progress against development objectives, but public resources alone will not be sufficient to address such high financing needs in developing countries. %
They will need to be used increasingly as a catalyst to attract private finance, especially to sectors that can transform developing
economies. %
However, investors often see markets in the poorest countries as too risky. %
To help fill this financing gap DFID plan to increase the use of instruments such as DevCap. %
This will then spur other private finance to follow over time, once DFID investment has created the demonstration effect necessary to attract investors. %
